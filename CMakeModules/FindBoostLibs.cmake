# This module finds headers and requested component libraries OR a CMake
# package configuration file provided by a "Boost CMake" build.  For the
# latter case skip to the "Boost CMake" section below.  For the former
# case results are reported in variables::
#
#   BoostLibs_FOUND        - True if headers and requested libraries were found
#   Boost_FOUND            - True if headers and requested libraries were found
#   Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Boost include directories
#   Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS     - Link directories for Boost libraries
#   Boost_LIBRARIES        - Boost component libraries to be linked
#   Boost_<C>_FOUND        - True if component <C> was found (<C> is upper-case)
#   Boost_<C>_LIBRARY      - Libraries to link for component <C> (may include
#                            target_link_libraries debug/optimized keywords)
#   Boost_VERSION          - BOOST_VERSION value from boost/version.hpp
#   Boost_LIB_VERSION      - Version string appended to library filenames
#   Boost_MAJOR_VERSION    - Boost major version number (X in X.y.z)
#   Boost_MINOR_VERSION    - Boost minor version number (Y in x.Y.z)
#   Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION - Boost subminor version number (Z in x.y.Z)
#   Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS (Windows)
#                          - Pass to add_definitions() to have diagnostic
#                            information about Boost's automatic linking
#                            displayed during compilation
#
# This module reads hints about search locations from variables::
#
#   BOOST_ROOT             - Preferred installation prefix
#    (or BOOSTROOT)
#   BOOST_INCLUDEDIR       - Preferred include directory e.g. <prefix>/include
#   BOOST_LIBRARYDIR       - Preferred library directory e.g. <prefix>/lib
#   Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS  - Set to ON to disable searching in locations not
#                            specified by these hint variables. Default is OFF.
#   Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
#                          - List of Boost versions not known to this module
#                            (Boost install locations may contain the version)
#
# and saves search results persistently in CMake cache entries::
#
#   Boost_INCLUDE_DIR         - Directory containing Boost headers
#   Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE - Directory containing release Boost libraries
#   Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG   - Directory containing debug Boost libraries
#   Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG   - Component <C> library debug variant
#   Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE - Component <C> library release variant
